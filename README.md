# LLM Integration for Enhancing Technical Ticket Resolution
This project presents the integration of a large language model (LLM) into an existing technical support ticket system to assist support staff in resolving inquiries more efficiently. 
The system was built around a fine-tuned Gemma-2-9b-it model enhanced with the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to ensure that generated responses were based on real, domain-specific data. Alongside few-shot learning, prompt engineering, 
and semantic classification and search via SentenceTransformer, the system provided a user-friendly interface to create an assistive AI tool tailored to real-world support workflows.
