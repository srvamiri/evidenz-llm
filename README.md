# LLM Integration for Enhancing Technical Ticket Resolution

This project presents the integration of a large language model (LLM) into an existing technical support ticket system to assist support staff in resolving inquiries more efficiently. 
The system is built around a fine-tuned [Gemma-2-9b-it](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) model enhanced with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, designed to improve technical ticket resolution.
Alongside few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and semantic classification and search via SentenceTransformer, the system provides a user-friendly interface to create an assistive AI tool tailored to real-world support workflows.
The system is accessed via a Streamlit interface and optionally served through an API.
